We can use bitwise operators to move through these. |

| Oct 13 |  5:30-6pm  |  I liked the idea of the cutoff because it allows you to remove large amounts of words at one time. I considered the idea of using both ideas above: fist finding a small section of DNA(your cutoff) in the middle and then using a sort of key of numbers that represents your DNA string to look there. This will make the searching part of the cutoffs quicker for when you don't have a long string of DNA. |
