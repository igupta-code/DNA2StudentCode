We can use bitwise operators to move through these. |

| Oct 13 |  5:30-6pm   | I liked the idea of the cutoff because it allows you to remove large amounts of words at one time. I considered the idea of using both ideas above: fist finding a small section of DNA(your cutoff) in the middle and then using a sort of key of numbers that represents your DNA string to look there. This will make the searching part of the cutoffs quicker for when you don't have a long string of DNA. |
| Oct 14 |  9-9:30am   |                                                                                                   After getting some hints from Mr. Blick, we talked a little more about representing each number using binary. We decided to create a map of length 26 to store the letters A, C, T, and G with their respective values. This will allow constant time look ups when searching for letters in the DNA sequence. |

| Oct 14 |  9:30-10am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Continued discussing some concepts above and I looked at some on the test cases and starter code. |
| Oct 14 | 7:15-7:45pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                               I never reall understood bitwise operators so I did some research on them. Just finding some basic examples and implementations helped me better visualize how I can use them in this problem set. |
| Oct 21 |  11:30-12   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I started coding: created a hash function, thought about how to set up my map for the letters, started on the iterating through the whole sequence. |
| Oct 21 |     1-2     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Finished the hash function and thought about how to traverse through STR repeats in an efficient way. Figured out how far I need to "look backwards" to ensure I wasn't missing any edge cases. |
| Oct 21 |   4:15-5    |                                                                                                                                                                                                       Finished a first draft of my code and will start testing. I used horner's method to find repeat STRs and spend some time making sure I was incrementing i in the right places(may still cause errors tho). |
| Oct 21 |   5-5:30    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Started testing: I found a bunch of small bugs -- lots of index out of bounds errors for places I started a loop wrong or inputted the wrong end value. |
| Oct 21 |   5:30-6    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I was getting a lot of errors with the way I was shifting over my window into the next sequence. I broke up the math to do it one step per each line so I could debug easier. |
| Oct 21 |   6-6:30    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I got test one working by finishing up the shift debugging and by changing the inputs into the hash method for when I get a string correct. Other tests still don't work. |
| Oct 23 |   9-9:30    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I was having an issue with the way I was going backwards to check my code. So I created a newSeqHash variable to keep track of where I am with my checking vs where I actually am in the string |
| Oct 24 |   9:30-10   |                                                                                                                        I fixed some out of bounds errors that I was getting by adding in a check to see if I am going out of bounds. I also made some speed ups: instead of using substring, I passed the start integer and the full sequence into the hash function. I also used bit shifting instead of power. |
